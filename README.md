- 👋 Hi, I’m @darrellsn
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. My love for solving complex problems along with the sense of accomplishment has brought me into the world of coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of how to code, currently working on basic foundations of HTML/CSS and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I'm pretty much a noob in my coding journey, barely scratching the surface.
- 📫 How to reach me: n/a
- ⚡ Future goal(s) is to create something monumental that could benefit the world. Helping people is one of my biggest desires and I desire to create something that would someday change people's lives for the better.
